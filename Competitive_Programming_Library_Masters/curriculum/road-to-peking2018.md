### Overview

Now, we are about to start an intensive one-year plan to get ready for Peking World Finals 2018. I am quite sure that if we managed
to follow this plan over all months, we will have red coders soon and this is a step close to performing well in the World Finals. It depends on the person and the period. We will always try to make a good
estimate for it.

The plan is split into four stages:

- **Stage 1** [June - August]: Gain strong knowledge and experience in all topics through
    - knowledge: topic sprints [Topcoder -> Competitive Programming -> Maximal -> ?].
    - experience: problems on known topics, but they have new ideas (some medium/hard problems).
    - contest experience: online contests with full analysis and upsolving.
    
- **Stage 2** [September - October]: Getting ready for nationals and regionals
    - revision on all topics: It's better to keep known topics fresh than learning new ones.
    - team contests: to keep contest mode on.
    
- **Stage 3** [November - January]: Advanced practice.

- **Stage 4** [February - April]: Getting ready for World Finals!

Teams who couldn't make their way to the world finals will be included in the plan, either for the next season or for improving their algorithmic skills.

### Stage 1 Plan
Right now, we are in stage 1 so let's talk about it more concretely.

#### Knowledge

Algorithms need refreshment from time to time. And according to my experience, learning a whole topic in one shot is not efficient
and can be easily forgotten. So, to keep topics alive as long as possible, we will make topic sprints where we pick a topic for
several days and solve problems on it. This process will go in cycles and at each cycle, we will use a different resource.

> To start fresh and new, we will begin with topcoder tutorials. My estimate for these tutorials are 20 days.

#### Experience

Solving problems with knowing a single tag for it is critically important. So, we will inject our practice day with some medium problems
on known topics and a few (possibly one) hard problems. Medium problems help you efficiently use the knowledge you have. Hard problems are
knowledge in themselves as they always contain ideas that are never mentioned in any standalone tutorial.

> Currently, I will choose medium problems from problems I solved before. Later, they will be some random problems from CF. For hard problems,
we will give ASC problems a good try. Can you imagine yourself if you solved 46 ASC contests?

#### Online contests

Keep your spirit high. Feel distinguished and competitive all the time. Upsolving will give you confidence to not fear problems anymore.
Any missed contest must be immediately resecheduled for virtual participation/upsolving.

> We will peacefully start with Hackerrank contests. Later, we will join Codeforces fights.

So, let's start with warm-up problems (please record time durations for the problems: thinking/coding/debugging):
- [Chinese Girls' Amusement](http://codeforces.com/gym/100199)
- [Matrix Multiplication](http://codeforces.com/gym/100199)
- [New Year Bonus Grant](http://codeforces.com/gym/100199)

Our practice sheet will be [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1reWwcoWl25MawrM9HqQNiVOPPe91HH2ZmIdbenBsnTM).

- Send an edit request with your gmail (used in the mailing list).
- Each row will describe a task either a topic or a problem.
- You will get a column at which you will put:
    - link to your solution (if on CF add submission link, otherwise add ideone link) with hyperlink word "code".
    - time in minutes (between brackets) you spent to finish the task.
- Follow the [facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1300348016749799) for discussions and announcements.
- Use comments in the sheet and orange/red cell color or fb group for discussions.
- If you have further notes, share them!
